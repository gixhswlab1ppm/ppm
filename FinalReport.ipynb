        "The Smart Ping Pong Paddle is able to use real-time swing detection, swing spectrum extraction, ball-hit detection and ball-hit quality scoring. These analytical features give you a basic understanding of your skill level and improvement for ping pong. We offer some functions on a stable release, with experimental functions for reference that my have some bugs. Furthermore, our experimental feature allows you to know the quality of your swings without the need to actually serve and hit balls, making it easier to practice without an expensive needing an expensive robot to launch balls at you. This feature allows you to practice your swing as you begin your ping pong journey, saving you from the laborious work of repeatedly hitting and collecting balls- you don't even need a ping pong table!\n",

        "We originally planned to classify between good/bad players, to classify different swings, and to classify additional variables around what makes a player good. However, it was difficult to attain well-labeled data for this (we had various forms of noise from our sensors that would change whenever we modified our device), and our project ran out of budget well in advance of being able to test out additional methods to get this sort of data without an additional device (such as a sepreate camera). As a result, we changed out project goal from being an over-arching device capable of improving any factor of a player's behavior, to simply providing a device that would allow beginners to improve and track their ping pong skills.\n",

In this way, we would hope to be able to develop numerous hardware prototypes and develop models for each of them to determine which setups worked best for our end results.\n",

        "\n",
        "We collected our data in three different ways:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. <b>Feasibility Test</b> Initially, we attached a cell phone to a ping pong paddle and used an app to collect acceleration and gyroscope data. The user being monitored swung the paddle repeatedly, as if he were serving a ball.\n",
        "  \n",
        "2. <b>FT - Advanced</b> As we started to develop machine learning models and other algorithms, we continued to use this device configuration but monitored additional users and had them either swing the paddle or to walk around intermittently.\n",
        "  \n",
        "3. <b>Milestone 1-3</b> Once we had our hardware device created, we began to use it to collect swing-related data from an Inertial Measurement Unit (MPU-6050) and to collect hit-related data using several piezoelectric discs. We asked several testers to repeatedly serve an actual ball, allowing natural practice (such as picking up balls, walking around, and taking breaks).\n",
        "\n",
        "For our third way, we had various hardware iterations that affected the scaling and noise for each dataset collected.\n",
        "  \n",
        "### *What features did your dataset have?*\n",
        "\n",
        "Our dataset had three primary feature categories:\n",
        "\n",
        "**Raw input features**: IMU acceleration/IMU angular velocity ($F^6$), piezoelectric disk reading which indicates vibration strength ($N^3$)\n",
        "\n",
        "**Manually labelled features**: Player Skill/Quality ($B$), Player ID ($N$)\n",
        "\n",
        "**Engineering features**: Ball Hitting Event ($N$), Ball Hitting Temporal Dispersity (BHTD)/Ball Hitting Spatial Dispersity (BHSD)/Ball Hitting Strength (BHS) ($F^3\\times N$), Top-K Signal In Frequency Domain ($F\\times N$), Hit Location.\n",

        "\n",
        "Some preprocessed features themselves are used as labels, such as the piezometer readings; other labels are manually annotated, such as player skill. Some tasks do not have labels.\n",
        "    \n",
        "For swing and hit detection, there were no labels. However, technically speaking, to fine-tune and verify the algorithms, we did manually visualize these features and counted swings and hits. The extra information generated by manually counting swings and hits is implicitly encoded into our model, thus could be treated as labels.\n",
        "    \n",
        "For hit quality prediction, labels are the aforementioned float-type engineering features including BHTD, BHSD, and BHS.\n",

        "### *How many samples did you collect?*\n",
        "\n",
        "<b>Feasibility Test</b> At least 5 valid files (tests) were collected, each consisting of 20+ swings and hits.\n",
        "   \n",
        "<b>Milestone 1-3</b> At least 13 valid files (tests) were collected, of which: \n",
        "* 10 of these tests consists of 120+ swings and hits\n",
        "* 2 of these tests consists of 0 swings or hits for zero offset detection purposes \n",
        "* 6 of these tests (with valid swings and hits) are well annotated with exact number of swings and hits, and the names of the testers to distinguish different swing/hit patterns among different testers. \n",
        "\n",
        "### *What is your final opinion of your dataset? If you could do it again, what would you change?*\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, our dataset has 20 groups of training data from 20 different individuals, in which each person swung the paddle at least 20 times. In our opinion, this dataset is large enough for the basic model to learn to provide a reasonable estimation. Although the total number of samples in the training dataset could be higher, we collected as many features as possible in the process, as advised from our class instructor. \n",
        "\n",
        "If we could do it all again, we would make sure that the data from sensors is easy to collect and process. As mentioned previously, our team struggled with piezos data collecting, so we would rather focus on the data processing from the inertial measurement unit. This would give us more time to proceed further in the machine learning process and retrieve deeper insights."

It did not fully meet our expectations but it is still useful. We can decrease our regression loss, shown in the below graphs, however, the testing accuracy can be higher.

This worked well (theoretically) if the hit is inside the triangle formed by the 3 discs; otherwise, it is not able to locate. We eventually dropped this feature due to the fact that sensor readings themselves are unreliable.\n",

After this, our algorithms learns appropriate thresholds for the player by taking 0.6 times the standard deviation along each dimension. This requires no zero-offseting of any dimension.\n",
        "    \n",
        "<b>Hit Detection/Counting</b> A similar mechanism is used for hit detection except that a hard-coded filter is applied to piezo disc readings before they are fed to auto-clustering steps. The maximum clustering window for hit detection is smaller than that used in swing detection.\n",
