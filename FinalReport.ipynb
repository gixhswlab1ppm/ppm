These circles have the same location with the deployed three piezo discs, and their diameters are linear to each reading of the sensors. It did not work too well because 1) a single intersection usually does not exist, 2) strong hits close to one sensor could result in a far-away location that is way off the paddle.\n",

        "    \n",
        "    If a threshold is not given (as is the case when our product \"meets\" a new player for the first time), we require the player to keep swinging for 10+ seconds. After this, our algorithms learns appropriate thresholds for the player by taking 0.6 times the standard deviation along each dimension. This requires no zero-offseting of any dimension.\n",

Some tweaks include: 1) we shifted the data first to align its mean to zero before feeding the data to FFT, 2) we drew a partition window to the temporal data if applicable so that we could handle a mixture of \"swings & walks\" better, 3) we only take some top 10% signals in the frequency domain to generate the spectrum, and 4) we converted frequency domain to period domain so that spectrum has a reasonable \"length\" along the x-axis (noises are usually of randomly-high frequency which have an extremely short period).\n",
